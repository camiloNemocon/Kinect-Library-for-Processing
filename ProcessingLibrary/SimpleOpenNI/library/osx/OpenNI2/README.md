* I downloaded the project from https://github.com/wexstorm/simple-openni

* I replaced the files SimpleOpenNI/library/NiTE2/Data/lbsdata.idx and SimpleOpenNI/library/NiTE2/Data/lbsdata.lbd
by the same files from working-with-processing2-simple-openni (when I downloaded wexstorm project this files were way too small)

* I copied "libfreenect.0.1.2.dylib" from working-with-processing2-simple-openni
(in my case /libraries/SimpleOpenNI/library/osx/OpenNI2/Drivers/libfreenect.0.1.2.dylib)
to the same folder in the wexstorm project. Also I copied /libraries/SimpleOpenNI/library/osx/OpenNI2/Drivers/libfreenect.0.4.0.dylib and 
/libraries/SimpleOpenNI/library/osx/OpenNI2/Drivers/libfreenect.0.1.2.dylib from the SimpleOpenNI that works in processing2
